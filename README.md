# Timebanking
Android based project for the Human Computer Interaction course at Politecnico di Torino
The application implements timebanking concept:
- The app supports reciprocal service exchange that uses units of time as currency
- Subscribers of the app have a time credit (in hours) that can be consumed asking other users to perform jobs for them and that is increased doing works for others
- Time exchange is based on skills, geographical location, and actual time slots
- A rating system is provided to share evaluations about the provided services
